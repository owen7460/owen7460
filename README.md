# Hello, world! ðŸ‘‹

### For me   

Hey! I'm Owen, an international student studying at SAIT  
I major in web design and development.  

I know this is just the beginning and where my dream starts.  
Hope one day I could be a brilliant **developer**, **designer** and **product manager**.

### Why did I choose this program
When I was studying at my conservatory of music, my friend and I created a platform to share those concerts' information to teachers and students, since then I was fascinated by these brilliant design, beautiful graphics and extraordinary fonts, and even found myself thinking about it as I fell asleep.  
In some way, I have been meaning to learn Web Design and Development, so this is the reason.
